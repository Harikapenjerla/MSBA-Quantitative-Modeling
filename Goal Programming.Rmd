Given Information:
 y1+ and y1-, respectively, as the amount over (if any) and the amount under (if any) the employment level goal.
 y2+ and y2- in the same way for the goal regarding earnings next year. 
 x1, x2, and x3 as the production rates of Products 1, 2, and 3, respectively. 

P in terms of x1,x2,x3 is P = 20x1 + 15x2 + 25x3.
/*Objective Function 

max: 20x1 + 15x2 + 25x3 - 6y1m -6y1p - 3y2m;

/*Constraints

6x1 + 4x2 + 5x3 - y1p + y1m = 50;
8x1 + 7x2 + 5x3 - y2p + y2m = 75;
